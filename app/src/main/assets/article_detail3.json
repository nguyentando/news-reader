The price floor was instrumental in maintaining ETH/BTC’s bullish bias during the mid-May 2021 notorious crypto market crash. It also served as solid support during the pair’s uptrend in the early May 2020 trading session. \n\n“Ethereum is continuing the run against the Bitcoin pair,” said van de Poppe."

          "content": "The bullish analogy appeared right as ETH/BTC stretched its price rebound, from its June 27 low of 0.0552 BTC, by 21.28%. It showed that more traders preferred to sell their Bitcoin holdings to seek opportunities in the Ether market in recent days. On a year-to-date timeframe, the second-largest cryptocurrency had already surged by more than 160% against Bitcoin.\n\nThe transition took cues from the euphoria surrounding Ethereum’s planned consensus layer transition from its energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) to a more scalable and cheaper proof-of-stake (PoS). The project launched the first phase, called Phase 0 or Beacon Chain, in December 2020. It introduced a so-called sharded network architecture to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSharding is a scaling technique that segments the Ethereum network into various groups (called shards). It then assigns nodes to each shard. These nodes have to monitor and validate their respective shards, thereby removing the need for each node to validate every transaction, which is the case in the current PoW consensus.\n\nThe next phase that brings Ethereum closer to PoS is the Ethereum improvement Proposal 1559, also known as the London hard fork. The upgrade proposes to replace Ethereum’s “first-price auction” fee model with a base network fee, modifiable per the network’s demand. It hopes to solve the blockchain’s higher gas and transaction fee problem. It also aims to make ETH a deflationary token by burning the base network fee."

The bullish formula is simple: Ether’s drying supply in circulation against rising demand would make it more valuable than it is currently. And as a result, the cryptocurrency has been rising against Bitcoin so far into 2021.\n\nAdditionally, CryptoQuant, a South Korea-based crypto analytics firm, reported a rising holding behavior among Ether traders, taking cues from their declining ETH reserves across all the cryptocurrency exchanges."

He cited ETH-based investments into the decentralized finance sector as the prime example.\n\n“Ethereum total value locked has soared in the past year. Staking in the forthcoming Ethereum 2.0 (proof-of-stake consensus model) has also absorbed the Ethereum leaving trading platforms,” Mazur said, adding:\n\n"
